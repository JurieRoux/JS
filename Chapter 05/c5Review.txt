//////Question 1. 
What is the expected output for the following code?

let step = 3;
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i += step) {
if (i > 10) {
break;
}
console.log(i);
}
ANSWER:
Intially code uses a for loop to iterate 0-1000 in step sizes of 3 - line16. 
However, in line17 there is a break statement if the value of i becomes greater than 10. So it will never go to 1000.
    0
    3
    6
    9

////Question 2.
What is the final value for myArray, and what is expected in the console?

const myArray = [1,5,7];
for(aa in myArray){
console.log(Number(aa));
aa = Number(aa) + 5;
console.log(aa);
}
console.log(myArray);

ANSWER:
For in loop used to iterate keys of the array. 
Variable aa is a string but won't affect the array elements ("for in loop funcitonality")

loop will iterate over keys (0,1,2) of array. 
loop adds 5 to each of the string index (0+5,1+5,2+5) - gets to 5,6,7


    0
    5
    1
    6
    2
    7
    [1, 5, 7] -elements in myarray remain unchanged
